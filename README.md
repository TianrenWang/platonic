## Software Project Description
We are currently creating a Conversation Management Platform in a form of a web application. In this platform, users can debate and address specific topics civilly and directly. This app mainly targets users who want to make intelligent conversations about very critical matters.

## Tools Used For Project Management
To manage our project, **GitHub** and **Basecamp** will be used. GitHub will host all of the source code files for our Conversation Management Platform. The new feature that we will add will be shown in our GitHub project. Basecamp will host all of the other project details such as Hill Charts, Project Tasks, and Team Details & Roles.
